If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan.  The Western drives
are notoriously noisy.  On the other hand, if you don't have a Western
drive, then maybe it is the fan.  There's not alot to do about it except
insulate around the cpu somehow.
