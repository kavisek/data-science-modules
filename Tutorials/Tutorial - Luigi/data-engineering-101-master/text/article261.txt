	Please define "morally straight". 

	
	
	And, don't even try saying that "straight", as it is used here, 
implies only hetersexual behavior. [ eg: "straight" as in the slang word 
opposite to "gay" ]


	This is alot like "family values". Everyone is talking about them, 
but misteriously, no one knows what they are.

        say "Mom", because of the love of their mom.  It makes for more 
        virile men."
