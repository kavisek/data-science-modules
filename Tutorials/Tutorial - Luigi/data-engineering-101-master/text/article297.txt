Welcome aboard!


(I think you just answered your own question, there)


Most responses were against his postings that spouted the fact that
all atheists are fools/evil for not seeing how peachy Islam is.
I would leave the pro/con arguments of Islam to Fred Rice, who is more
level headed and seems to know more on the subject, anyway.


How did you know I was going to welcome you abord?!?
