I have an addition to the FAQ regarding "why are there no atheist
hospitals."

If I recall correctly, Johns Hopkins was built to provide medical
services without the "backing" of a religious group...thus making it a
hospital "dedicated to the glory of [weak] atheism."

Might someone check up on this?
