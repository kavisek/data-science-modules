There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.
