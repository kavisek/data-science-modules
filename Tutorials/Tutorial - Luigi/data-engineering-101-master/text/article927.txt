Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).
