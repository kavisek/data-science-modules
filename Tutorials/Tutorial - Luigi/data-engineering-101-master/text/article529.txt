I have the same question as Guido. It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave ? 
At the moment , I have been using the ESDI drive and recently I bought a IDE drive to use as the 2nd drive . 
The person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard ( ESDI AND IDE ) but I think there might be some way of making them work. Can anybody enlighten me on this?
And it is possible to  run a ESDI HDD using a IDE controller? or vice versa?
Can anybody please help me out on this?
Your help will be very much appreciated.
