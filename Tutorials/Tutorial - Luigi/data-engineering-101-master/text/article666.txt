: As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists.
: It is an MO drive.  MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive
: and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new
digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone
from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD
is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when
pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!
