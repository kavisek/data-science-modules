Wait a minute.  I thought you said that Allah (I presume Allah == God) was unknowable,
and yet here you are claiming to know a very concrete fact about him.

You say that God does not have a "face".  Doesn't the bible say that God has hindparts?

How do you suggest I decide which (if any) of you is right?  Or are you both right?
God has hindparts but no face?  Or does your use of quotation marks:

	God does not have a "face".

allow you to interpret this to mean whatever you like?
