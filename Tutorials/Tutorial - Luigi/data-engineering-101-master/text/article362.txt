That figure (1/4") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12").


I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor
(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).


I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these
"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.
