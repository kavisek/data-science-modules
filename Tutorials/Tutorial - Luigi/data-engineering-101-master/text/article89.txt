I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
My 2 cents worth:

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. 
A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think
the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard
is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't
light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.

If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.

Hope this helps.
