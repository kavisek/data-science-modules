Yes, and everyone thinks as you do.  No one thinks that he is going to cause
or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.

You mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  And, you should

But, most people have found the risk to be acceptable.  You are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric

that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk
is acceptable.  "Acceptable" is the fudge factor necessary in such an
approximation to the ideal.
