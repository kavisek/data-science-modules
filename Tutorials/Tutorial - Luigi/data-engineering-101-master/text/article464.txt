There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much
expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it
from someone else.

However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.
This is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a
16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering"
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

Hope this helps...
