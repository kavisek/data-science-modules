IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.


You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.


And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.
