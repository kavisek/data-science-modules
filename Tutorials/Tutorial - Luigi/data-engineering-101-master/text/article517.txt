Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware: 19-Apr-93 AMD i486
clones: Now legal .. by poe@wharton.upenn.edu 

It's true.  I read about it from an article in ClariNet (can't send it
here though).  U.S. District Court Judge William A. Ingram, of San
Francisco, threw out the jury verdict prohibiting AMD from using Intels'
microcode for the 486.
