I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT.
