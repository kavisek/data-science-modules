comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware


Hmmmmmm...I got my comp with windows pre-installed, and stacks is still
9,256.  if it was needed only for setup, wouldn't the morons take it
off???  (also, I don't have the qemm manual, as verything came with the
comp,  but not the qemm manual, so could anyone verify this???)
