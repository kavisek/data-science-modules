G'day All,

I was looking to build a Parallel Port Digital to Analogue Converter the other
day and came across this schematic which I promptly threw together on a piece
of VeroBoard:


     P2----22k----+
     P3----48k----|
     P4----100k---|
     P5----200k---|
     P6----400k---|
     P7----800k---|    10uf electrolytic
     P8----1M6----|  +
     P9----3M2----+---||--+----------
                          |            +
            47nF ceramic  -   
                          -
                          |            -
     P25------------------+----------


(Please excuse the obvious limits of the Lower ASCII char set :=)

I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box.

Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name
of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal
behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/
better designs/improvements/wastepaper bin... etc?

Many thanks for a reply via this conference or email.
