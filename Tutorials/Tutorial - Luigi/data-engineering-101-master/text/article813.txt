Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.

VGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About
	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the 
	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses
	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look
like?

Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?
