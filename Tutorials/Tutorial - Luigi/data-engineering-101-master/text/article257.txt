Yes only your $00.02.  Here's mine.

If I were running at a new chip at a Trade show, and had little to no real
technical knowledge,  I wouldn't let some stranger with a diskette boot my demo
machine.  If the demo machine is down too long people will not see my nice
demos, and if this purposted LINUX diskette is really something that will wipe
the disk, or is loaded with a VIRUS!, I'm in deep trouble.

No marketer in their right mind would let you do this, unless they had
specifically invited people to do so, and provided machines to do it with.

We can we learn : This technology will be shipping from PC vendors in May 1993,
and will be i486 compatible.
