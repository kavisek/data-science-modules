I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but
only 16 colour. You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.


I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're
fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like
a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards
arrive, I'll buy one.


Over the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19" monitor, more
memory (20MB just ain't enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh
well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-)
