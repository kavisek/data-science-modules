If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what
purpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
with the general goal.


In an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged
as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is,
the goals of each society are different.

Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.


I've said it many, many times.


Which part do you have a problem with?


But, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or
are you a vegetarian for health reasons?


No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.


Of course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species
for food.  It might be nice, though, if the other animals were not made
to suffer.  For instance, a cow in a field lives out its life just about
the same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However,
the veal youngsters aren't treated very well.


I don't know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no
inherent system.


Nope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food.
