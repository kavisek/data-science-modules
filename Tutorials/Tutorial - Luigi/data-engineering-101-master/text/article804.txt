Hello,

in the EDN magazine I found a note about the new C&T 82C735
I/O Controller. It support several parallel port protocols,
including
	Fast Centronics
	Microsoft Enhanced Capabilities Protocol (ECP)
	Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP)
The last two handle data rates up to 2Mbytes/sec.

Is there any specification about these protocols available?

Regards,
