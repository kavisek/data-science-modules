I have a WANGTEK tape controller card (Revision E) that was used with the
Sytos backup system to take backups of a friend's system. That system has
crashed and I'm attempting to restore it.

Unfortunately, the documentation for this ancient card has been lost in the
mists of time, and I need to know the DMA, IRQ and address for this card.

Can anyone suggest how I could determine these things?

There is a bank of dip switches on the card which are set to:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    UPUPUP    UPUPUP
UPUP      UPUP

Thanks for your time.
