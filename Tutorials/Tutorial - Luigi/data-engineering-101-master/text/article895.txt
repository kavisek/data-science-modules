First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good
cohesive set of SCSI drivers.
