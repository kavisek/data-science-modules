    I've been using the Build59 drivers on a GW2K 4DX2-66V for several
weeks with no problems. I'm running Windows in 1024x758 and all software
I've run has worked fine. This includes many games and the CD-based 
multi-media encyclopedia, on which the full-motion video works fine.
I'd recommend you give them a try.
