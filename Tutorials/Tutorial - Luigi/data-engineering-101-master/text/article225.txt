Hi,
	I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a
	HDD/FDD controller. Is 32-bit VL-bus HDD/FDD controller faster 
	than 16 bit IDE HDD/FDD controller card? I hear that
	the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller?
	Which one is true?

	Please shed some light by email or post.
	Thanks a lot.

Best regards,
