Just to let all you faithful Mitsumi CD Rom owners....

Ever notice QEMM can't load you CD Rom driver high?  Ain't it a bitch?

Well, you can call up Quarterdeck's BBS and get a hold of the new drivers
that CAN be loaded high.  Sorry , I don't have their # on me. :-(

I tested them out and the seem to work great!
