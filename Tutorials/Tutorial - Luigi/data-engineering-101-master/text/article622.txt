In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine. 

However, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, 
CMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be. 

When unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:

Clock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too.
