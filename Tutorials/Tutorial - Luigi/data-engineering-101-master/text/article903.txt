	I have a similar configuration: Colorado 250mb on 66 DX/2 tower.



	You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing
	that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.
	The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it 
	"marketing."  Lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."
	Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on 
	their corporate headquarters.


	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do 
	the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape 
	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for 
	the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block 
	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?


	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the 
	TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration
	file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup
	from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.


	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive
	won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.
