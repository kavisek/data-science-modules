Too right it does!


The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't
already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)
get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)

Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair
shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).
